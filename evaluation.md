1) I feel pretty confident with the arrays we have learned so far.  Each line was tested with puts, and they were all right on the first try.

2) I would like to learn how to wrap programmar notes.   Comments start to get unwieldly if I want to write anything longer than a sentence.

3) When I puts an array, the elements are listed, but not in the orientation that I would expect.  They are presented one line at a time, instead of displayed in a horizontal fashion.  Is this normal?
